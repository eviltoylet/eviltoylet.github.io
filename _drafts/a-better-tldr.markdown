TLDR is the acronym for **T**oo **L**ong **D**idn't **R**ead and it is a blurb displayed at the top or bottom of a long run of text.
And, in programmer speak, this is of course an abstraction. 

The TLDR is best generated by the author, and then someone who has read the article. However, what if we could propose a way for
someone to annotate what the TLDR sentence is. That is, all someone needs to do is include a sentence that summarizes the entire section.

Granted, the chapter titles are supposed to be the summary of what's going on. But we really need more information.

What if books could be done like this?

This might not work for things like fictional books, since we don't want to ruin the plot. In which case, we may want to hide by default.

Volume/Book
Chapter
Paragraph


Most suited to writing that is logically grouped by paragraphs. Read, poetry is probably not a good way to implement this.

Is there a programmatic way to generate a TLDR? That is, figure out what the most important sentence in a paragraph is and then
extract that out. Can this be done in JavaScript? Okay, maybe we need a GitHub project for this particular thing.
