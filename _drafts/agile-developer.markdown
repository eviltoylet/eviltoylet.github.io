Put information in here on how we should take the methodologies of Agile and apply it to our own real life. Point out new year's resolution to being very synonymous with waterfall.
We need a way to fail fast and to fail often so that we can improve upon it. Therefore, things need to be setup to be agile.

However, most of the interactions that we have are with people. And people withold information and lie. For example, they may tell you the cake is delicious. Even though it may
be a complete lie. (you cooked it with expired butter, wheat flour, and salt instead of sugar).

Baking itself isn't really agile. However, cooking is. You can sample and taste as you go. 

But this might mean that you won't get good at something like baking. Yes, it might not, but here you can draw on the experiences of other people. There are test kitchens that are
setup to determine whether or not adding more sugar, or less sugar, or at various stages is better for the end product. Draw upon their experience and copy it.

However, cooking is highly personal. You do what you think is the best for you. Feedback is from you.

However, unless you're cooking for other people. Then feedback is from other people.

# Pair Programming
 on what's right and what's wrong.Finding a partner in life who's going to give you immediate feedback. Any disagreements, you basically have to convince the other person that your way is correct.
