Speed reading is a vital skill because it gets you through a lot more information quickly. Especially given that most texts
contain a lot of filler. There are probably two techniques to help you out.

# Manual Speed Reading
The traditional way in which you use your fingers and don't vocalize.

# Computer Assisted Reading
Take advantage of a computer to show you words so that you can read faster. This is flashing words on screen at a certain rate. Can we create some sort of widget to do this?

# Open Questions
- What happens if you blink?
- Built in breaks?
- Are there some words that are more difficult to read than others? That is, what if easier words were substituted?
- I'm not sure if I like the concept. That is, can't we just listen to music at a faster speed and claim that it's more efficient? It really removes the enjoyment out of it. There isn't time for visualization.

There's really two ways to treat this. One is to read faster and the other is to shorten the content. Shortening the content could mean things like displaying visuals, or videos, or audio.
