If it weren't bad enough to have an entire website dedicated to my musings, this page is about me! I'm an experienced
software developer with {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: 2007 }}+ years of experience who's always striving for self 
improvement. I am passionate about clean, maintainable, and testable code. As well as analogies.

I am always looking for new, exciting, and challenging opportunities. Need my help or wit? Email me.
